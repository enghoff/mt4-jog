        firmware-side path, instead of a blocking `move_to()` per point.

        EVERY waypoint (the last included) goes out as `mq`: the first
        cold-starts if the arm is idle, the rest queue behind it and splice
        in without the per-waypoint stop/settle/reaccel cycle (see the `mq`
        protocol doc in firmware/mt4_jog/src/main.cpp for what is and isn't
        smoothed -- each leg still ramps down near its own end). The last
        leg must NOT be an `mp`: firmware `mp` mid-flight is an immediate
        override that drops every still-queued leg and cuts straight from
        wherever the arm is to its own target -- exactly the corner the
        queued route exists to avoid.

        Completion: the firmware emits one "mp done pos ..." each time its
        queue drains -- normally once, at the very end, but a short leg can
        finish before the next `mq` lands, draining the queue early; that
        next `mq` then cold-starts a fresh path (acked "ok mq" instead of
        "ok mq queued N"). So this counts cold-start acks and waits for
        that many "mp done" lines; anything less risks returning while the
        arm is still moving (and poisoning the next camera capture).

        `j4` is a world-frame yaw in degrees applied to every leg, or a
        firmware-resolved sentinel: None / "hold" holds world yaw, "wrist"
        holds the J4 *joint* angle leg-by-leg across each J1 swing (the
        firmware resolves either at each leg's OWN plan time, from
        wherever the previous leg actually ended -- true per-leg wrist
        behavior, which no up-front host-side value could reproduce; use
        "wrist" for transit routes with big base swings). No `?` status
        probe is sent: the firmware validates homing on every `mq` itself
        ("err not homed" comes back in the failure dict), which also makes
        this safe to use as the awaited finisher after raw `queue_move()`
        calls.

        `grip` (if nonzero) fires on the FIRST leg only, matching a single
        `move_to()` call's semantics -- for a gripper action partway through
        a route, call `gripper()` directly between `move_path()` calls
        rather than threading it through here.
