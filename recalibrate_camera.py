"""Refit the table-plane camera calibration after the camera moves --
*without* touching the arm, when the robot base and markers are known not
to have moved.

calibrate_vision.py's touch step exists to discover each marker's robot-
frame XY by jogging the TCP onto it -- but if the robot and markers are
unchanged, those XYs (already stored in vision_calibration.json's
raw_marker_observations) are still correct. All the camera move actually
invalidated is the *pixel* side of each correspondence. So this script:

  1. Loads the existing calibration's per-marker robot XYs (no arm motion).
  2. Captures a fresh frame and auto-detects each marker's *current* pixel
     center + corners.
  3. Refits the table-plane homography from (new pixel, old robot) pairs,
     via the same table_fit.fit_table_map() calibrate_vision.py uses.
  4. Backs up the old calibration, then saves the new one -- clearing
     cube_top_homography, since that correction was fit at the *old*
     camera pose and does not carry over. Run calibrate_height.py next
     (that step is already fully automatic -- no human input needed).

If the "robot and markers didn't move" assumption is wrong, this produces a
confidently wrong calibration with no independent way to catch it from
pixels alone -- the consistency check below (does one homography explain
every marker's old robot XY from its new pixel position) is internal, not
proof the assumption holds. An outlier usually *does* mean a marker moved
(or the wrong marker id matched, or its original touch was recorded off)
and is worth investigating before trusting the result. The check uses the
worst of the in-fit and leave-one-out errors: least squares smears a single
bad correspondence across all markers, so the culprit's own in-fit residual
can sit under the threshold while its leave-one-out error -- refit without
it, then measure it -- shows the disagreement at full size.

Usage:
  python recalibrate_camera.py --camera 1
  python recalibrate_camera.py --camera 1 --dry-run   # fit and report only
