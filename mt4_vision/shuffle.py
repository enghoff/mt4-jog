"""Indefinite cube shuffle loop (see shuffle_blocks.py CLI).

Plans only from the latest camera frame via detection-as-state Scene.
No synthetic cubes, no camera-park retreat: if the arm obscures a cube or
marker, that object simply isn't in the scene. Ghosts must be filtered out
of pick candidates; they are never "handled" as grips.

The one deliberate exception is `last_place`: the destination of the last
completed move is passed to plan_shuffle so it deprioritizes (never
excludes) re-picking that same cube next cycle. Unlike the old removed
"LastAttempt" stigma -- which hid grasp/vision bugs by refusing to repeat a
move at all -- this only prefers variety and always falls back to the same
cube if it is the only pickable one.

Lookahead: before executing a planned move, also ask plan_shuffle (via
_lookahead_action) whether a *second*, independent move is already visible
in that same capture. If so, both moves run back to back under one
continuous begin_motion()/end_motion() span -- no capture, settle pause, or
verification happens between them, only after the pair. This trades
verifying the first move immediately for fewer pauses; a first move that
actually failed still shows up as a pickable cube on the next real capture,
just one cycle later than it otherwise would.
