 * (world yaw rotates with the base) -- the firmware-native version of the
 * host-side j4_preserve_wrist(), which big base swings need because a
 * world-yaw hold there commands joint J4 = world - j1 past its soft

 * starts immediately -- a cold start identical to `mp`, just acknowledged

 * queue (MQ_QUEUE_CAPACITY deep; "err mq full" beyond that) and picked up,
 * without stopping, when the leg currently running finishes its segments --
 * same no-stop splice `mp`'s in-flight retarget already uses, but (unlike a
 * live retarget) each queued leg's route is *fully* replanned with the same
 * keep-out/soft-limit feasibility sweep a cold-start `mp` runs, since queued
 * waypoints are host-planned jumps (e.g. around a cube stack), not a live
 * tracker's small incremental corrections -- skipping that sweep would let
 * the firmware substitute its own unchecked straight chord instead of the
 * route the host actually vetted. Every queued leg (and the currently
 * executing one, if it came off the queue) still individually ramps down
 * near its own end before ramping back up for the next -- this removes the
 * per-waypoint stop/settle/full-reaccel cycle and serial round trip, but
 * does not (yet) give one flat-cruise ramp across the whole queue. An `mp`
 * sent while a queue is in flight keeps its existing override behavior
 * (immediate retarget to the new target) and drops any still-pending queued
 * legs. Async completion of the *whole* queue reuses "mp done pos ...". */
