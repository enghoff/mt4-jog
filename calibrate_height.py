"""Calibrate the cube-top-height pixel->robot correction, fully autonomously.

The main calibration (calibrate_vision.py) fits a homography from markers
lying flat on the table -- accurate for anything at table height (confirmed
by goto-marker landing dead-on), but cubes are detected by their top face,
cube_height_mm above the table, and camera parallax shifts that face's pixel
position enough to matter: ~15-19mm of pick error measured directly against
known-accurate marker coordinates.

This script measures that shift directly by placing a cube at a grid of
robot-frame points spread across the reachable workspace and photographing
where it lands -- the ground truth here is the arm's own positioning (we
choose the target and command the arm there directly), not a marker at all,
so unlike marker-only calibration this doesn't need any correspondence to
already-calibrated points.

A first attempt fit only 3 points (the 3 reachable markers) exactly (zero
residual) and made pick accuracy *worse*, not better: unlike marker corner
detection (sub-pixel precise), a cube's color-blob centroid is noisy --
lighting, slight rotation, partial occlusion -- and a 3-point exact affine
has zero redundancy to average that noise out; it just bakes the noise into
the fit. Sampling more points across the workspace gives real least-squares
averaging (and enables a full homography once >=4 points are collected).

No human interaction needed -- the arm places its own calibration probe.
