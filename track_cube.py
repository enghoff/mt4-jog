"""Visually servo the gripper to hover over a single moving cube.

Holds the TCP a fixed height above the table (default 5cm) directly over
one cube and follows it as it's moved by hand. Only one cube is tracked at
a time -- if several are in view, whichever reachable one is detected first
is locked on and identity is then held via nearest-neighbor gating (not
color alone, since two cubes can share a color), never opportunistically
re-targeted.

Two phases:

  1. Setup (`Mt4Client`, blocking `mp`): home if needed, find an initial
     reachable cube, and move the TCP to hover directly above it. This
     reuses the well-tested absolute-move path for the one large motion in
     the whole run.
  2. Tracking (raw serial, streaming `mp`): `Mt4Client.move_to()` blocks
     until the whole move completes, so this script instead re-sends a
     bounded absolute move (`mp x y z j4 g speed_us`) every tick, retargeting
     it to the cube's latest position before the previous one finishes. This
     used to be done with the firmware's Cartesian jog (`cj dx dy dz`)
     instead -- direction-only, no notion of a destination, so *something*
     external always has to decide when to stop it, and that something was
     this host loop's ~100ms-stale glance at position: overshoot wasn't a
     stepper coasting past the target (steppers don't coast), it was the
     arm faithfully stepping in the last commanded direction for the entire
     gap between one position sample and the next. `mp` moves the stop
     decision into firmware, which tracks its own remaining step count and
     halts exactly there, no host reaction time involved. The one thing that
     took firmware work to support was retargeting *mid-flight* without an
     abrupt stop -- see start_absolute_move()'s in-flight-retarget path in
     motion.cpp -- so a moving cube gets a continuously updated destination
     instead of finish-then-redirect. This script closes `Mt4Client` and
     opens its own serial connection for the loop, since only one process
     may own the COM port at a time.

Each tick (paced by the camera, ~10Hz measured on this setup):
  - grab the freshest frame and detect cubes
  - match the tracked cube by nearest position (same color, within a gate);
    the target is just that raw matched position, no velocity estimate or
    smoothing filter over it (deliberately dropped -- see git history if
    reintroducing lead-time prediction is ever worth revisiting)
  - request a fresh real TCP pose every tick (`pos`, fire-and-forget) and
    pick up the reply whenever it lands -- kept off the critical path so it
    never blocks the loop, but still only a tick or so stale
  - re-send `mp` toward the target with a distance-scheduled speed_us (see
    speed_for_distance), but only once the previous `mp` has actually been
    acknowledged (see awaiting_mp_ack) -- this is bang-bang + a gain
    schedule, not PID, there's no integral or derivative term -- the
    firmware absorbs a resend's retargeting by ramping the applied step
    rate toward whatever speed_us was just requested instead of snapping to
    it, so a changing distance-to-target (and therefore a changing
    requested speed) doesn't itself produce a jerk
  - once inside the deadband, stop re-sending `mp` and let whatever move is
    already in flight arrive and hold on its own -- no explicit `stop`,
    since `mp` decelerates into its own destination and forcing a stop here
    would trade that smooth arrival for an abrupt one

If the cube is lost from view for longer than a short grace period, or Ctrl+C
is hit, or a re-home is requested, the arm sends an explicit `stop` and holds
position, watching for the same cube to reappear anywhere in view -- it never
switches to a different cube.

Ctrl+C (or any error) always sends `stop` before exiting -- there is no
firmware watchdog that stops `mp` on its own if the host goes quiet.

# Real TCP feedback is requested every tick but never blocked on: a `pos`
# query is fired fire-and-forget (send_quick) and its reply is picked up
# opportunistically whenever it shows up in the buffer already being
# drained for firmware chatter (report_firmware_lines). This gives TCP
# feedback that's stale by about one tick (~40-60ms) instead of the several
# hundred ms a synchronous send(wait=...) would cost every tick.
#
# A synchronous per-tick poll was tried first and did fix a real bug (a
# multi-tick blind window where the arm kept jogging on a stale position
# estimate, overshot the target during it, and reversed hard once the next
# poll revealed the overshoot -- a feedback-deadtime limit cycle, confirmed
# live as TCP y oscillating ~40-70mm around a perfectly stationary target).
# But blocking ~150-200ms per tick throttled the whole loop from
# ~15-30Hz (camera-bound) to ~5-6Hz, and a bang-bang controller that looks
# smooth at high update rate looks like discrete steps at a low one --
# nothing about the motion logic changed, just how coarse each visible
# correction segment became. The async version keeps the fast loop rate
# and keeps the blind window short enough not to matter.
# Requested speed ramps with distance-to-target: fast (the firmware's
# quickest step rate) while far away, slower as it converges. This IS
# load-bearing, confirmed by removing it: even with fresh per-tick TCP
# feedback, a constant max-speed approach overshoots the 3mm deadband within
# a single ~100ms tick (real linear speed at max jog covers more than that
# easily), and the correction the next tick overshoots the other way -- a
# sustained oscillation with no feedback-staleness involved at all, just
# velocity too high relative to deadband width and tick period.
#
# Each resend's requested speed_us comes from this schedule -- motion.cpp's
# in-flight-retarget path (dda_continue_ramp) is what smooths the applied
# step rate toward each newly requested speed_us on the firmware's own
# clock, so a changing schedule value never itself produces a jerk, the
# same way `cjramp` did for `cjspeed` before this script switched from `cj`
# to `mp`. That smoothing is cheap -- but unlike `cj` (a direction+speed
# re-arm), an `mp` call itself is NOT: it solves IK and plans a
# keep-out-clear route (in-flight retargets now skip the route's IK
# feasibility sweep, reusing the in-flight path's detour radius when the
# chord doesn't clear -- see plan_mp_xy_route -- but target IK, route
# geometry, and parsing remain), real work on an 8-bit AVR with no FPU. An earlier version of this constant gated resends
# on target drift (skip unless the target moved >= 5mm since the last `mp`
# actually sent) to protect against that cost -- confirmed necessary at the
# time: resending every ~100ms tick regardless of whether the target moved
# was blocking firmware's loop() long enough (55-420ms, scaling with
# distance -- motion.cpp's mp_estimate_path_ticks() was solving IK once per
# ~2mm segment of the whole path just to time the accel/decel ramp) that
# the AVR's UART RX buffer filled and silently dropped bytes, corrupting
# `mp` lines (`err mp <x> <y> <z> <j4> <g> [speed_us]`) or splicing two
# lines together (`err unknown`). But gating on drift instead of just
# eating the cost had its own failure mode, also confirmed live: it let the
# arm coast to the end of its current (now slightly stale) target and sit
# there -- since `mp` is a bounded move that finishes and holds on its own
# once nothing new is sent -- until enough drift finally accumulated to
# unblock the next send, which then had no in-flight move left to splice
# onto and had to cold-start, seen as the arm stopping dead and jerking
# forward again while being tracked continuously in one direction. Fixing
# mp_estimate_path_ticks() to use a cheap straight joint-space chord
# instead of a per-segment IK sum (see motion.cpp) cut the block to a flat
# ~65-110ms independent of distance -- but that's still comparable to this
# loop's own ~100ms tick, and send_quick never waits for a reply, so
# resending unconditionally again just traded byte-loss for a different
# problem: Python outpacing what firmware could actually drain, queuing up
# an ever-growing backlog of already-stale targets that landed in an
# uneven rhythm (confirmed live as tcp alternating small/big steps between
# polls -- the arm executing whatever the queue caught up to, not the
# current camera-fresh target). See awaiting_mp_ack in run_tracking_loop:
# gating resends on the firmware's own ack self-paces to its real
# throughput without an arbitrary constant, and unlike the drift gate it
# never withholds a send once firmware is actually ready.
