"""Build a cube stack on a calibrated ArUco marker.

The stack site is a marker id passed on the CLI (required -- no default).
Any cubes within SITE_CLEAR_MM of that marker are nudged aside along the
marker→cube direction to CLEAR_PARK_MM (keep-clear + margin) first, preferring
landings that stay inside the pick hull and out of the stack camera-shadow
corridor (with open-table free slots as fallback). Each stack cube is taken
with the calibrate_height centering
sequence (yaw-pick → release → lift → rotate J4 90° → re-grip) via
``pick_centered``, then placed at the marker's calibrated XY by dead
reckoning. Placement Z steps by ``cube_height_mm`` from the calibration;
there is no visual alignment or post-place verification.

Stack motion is planned by ``mt4_vision.stackpath.StackPlanner``: transits
route the gripper *and* forearm around the growing column, the carry lifts
diagonally to a stage point beside the stack and hops over the top at a
hover height fitted under the joint-limit z ceiling (~315mm at the marker
radii), and the retreat lifts the fingers free of the placed cube while the
ceiling allows it, switching to a slide-out perpendicular to the jaw axis
for the top level(s). That slide is what makes level 9 buildable: lifting
the fingers clear of a 9th cube needs ~324mm of TCP height, which the J3
soft limit cannot reach.
